  . 👩‍💻 Dear Engineer, Our Tech Lead Role in 🌲 Palo Alto...
AUG 6, 2023
… is open! As Harmony’s founder, I’d like to tell you below about the project, your role, and what we are looking for from you.
Ideally you specialize in performance, security and systems – with 3 years of working experience, a degree in computer science, and regular practice of open-source development. You may have built a kernel, a compiler, or a database from scratch before; you enjoy Hacker News, functional idioms, and productivity tools every day.
This “Tech Lead” role is full-time, permanent, onsite in our Palo Alto headquarters in California. The compensation, with a base salary and vesting equity, may range from $160K to $210K. We offer full benefits but not a working visa. You should live within a 30-minute commute to work in office every day; you must love the long work hours and the chaotic grind of startups over years.
We have 6 full-time teammates in office, 15 more across Europe and Asia. You will be working directly with the leadership team of myself, Casey, and Aaron. I lead the team in platform vision, market strategy, and product roadmap. Casey leads in protocol research, network system, and developer community. Aaron leads in backend architecture, product design, and user applications.
You may start with our current initiatives on AI bots, Telegram wallets, domain auctions… then explore our broader roadmap of decentralized protocols, financial products, or cryptographic primitives. Harmony’s mission is “to scale trust and create radically fair economy”. Our next milestones include crypto payments for AI models and products on Telegram, social wallets without separate passwords or devices, and sustainable collectible auctions for .country domains.
Harmony is among the first proof-of-stake, sharding blockchains. Our 2-second transaction finality is one of the fastest; our 1000-slot validator network is one of the most diverse. The project started 5 years ago – launching the network and the ONE token in 2019, staking and delegation in 2020, DeFi and NFT in 2021, DAO and ZK Proofs in 2022, and now Web3 domains and AI bots in 2023. Harmony is venture-backed with its network utility tokens available on crypto exchanges and its treasury of more than 3 years of runway.
You will be challenged to launch features within the first few weeks, and soon to lead a team of 2 to 4 engineers. You will develop an open blockchain of hundreds of network nodes with hundreds of millions of assets. You will pioneer how applying generative models, low-rank adaptation and edge-device inference will bring productivity as well as entertainment to millions of users. You will be an industry leader, engaging in public forums or with our developer ecosystem, not only for your technical expertise but also your empathetic value.
Our backends, written in Go, run on Amazon and other clouds. Our middlewares, written in Solidity, deploy as Ethereum smart contracts. Our frontends, written in Javascript, deploy as React applications. As our commitment to open development and community blockchain, we share all code as public repos on Github and we share development meetings as public videos on YouTube.
You will first have a full-hour interview each with Li, Kushagra and myself in office. Li leads on operations, while Kushagra advises and consults on human resources. You will send in advance your past sample work of a full-page writing and a 100-line code snippet. You will join our lunch to chat with other teammates. The next steps are technical interviews with Aaron and Casey on Zoom, another day of onsite sessions, and finally a 2-day paid joint-work session. The decision and the offer usually come within 24 hours. Your employment may start within a week, ideally before October 15th.
Apply now on harmony.one/lever? You may learn more from the long posts “ONE Bot on Telegram for AI” and “Radically Fair for 1.country” on my Substack blog.s.country. Feel free to contact me anytime via s@harmony.one or Telegram @stephentse.

🤝 Blockchain Protocol: Scaling & Security
Harmony’s vision is to create cooperation for global communities, and scale their digital economies.
1. Secure, Random State Sharding
Harmony has transcended the blockchain trilemma by bringing the best research to production. Sharding is proven to scale blockchains without compromising security and decentralization.
We divide not only our network nodes but also the blockchain states into shards, scaling linearly in all three aspects of machines, transactions and storage.‍ To prevent single shard attacks, we must have a sufficiently large number of nodes per shard and cryptographic randomness to re-shard regularly. Each shard has 250 nodes for strong security guarantee against Byzantine behaviors. We use Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) for unbiasable and unpredictable shard membership.
2. Effective PoS & Token Economics
Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism for network security and economics. Our Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) reduces centralization and distributes rewards fairly to thousands of validators. Our staking mechanism supports delegation and reward compounding.
To support 100% uptime but fully open participation, EPoS slashes validators who double-sign and it penalizes elected but unavailable nodes.Harmony Economics Model caps the annual issuance at 441 million tokens (about 3% rate in long term). Our model gives validators a simple and predictable return. All transaction fees are burnt to offset the issuance, naturally leading to zero inflation when our network usage becomes high.
3. Fast Consensus, Instant Finality
Harmony has innovated on the battle-tested Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) for fast consensus of block transactions. Our Fast BFT (FBFT) leads to low transaction fees and 1-block-time finality in Harmony Mainnet.‍
We use Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) constant-sized signatures to commit blocks in a single round of consensus messages. We achieve 2-second block time with view changes in production against adversarial or unavailable leaders.‍ Harmony Mainnet was launched in June 2019. Our network has produced 41M blocks with 772k transactions in publicly traded, native ONE tokens.
4. Keyless Smart Wallets
Resilient. Funds are recoverable through time locks and multiple safety nets. No single point of failure such as thefts, cracks, loss, censorship or coercions is catastrophic.
Sufficient. All steps are well defined without delegating to hardware devices or seed phrases in safety boxes. Users do not need any passwords or rely on biometrics.
Composable. One-time or low-entropy passwords are useful for small funds. Multiple authentications can independently boost protection thresholds against brute-force.
Self-Sovereign. No third parties, government documents, designated guardians, backup servers or hardware enclaves are necessary. Users have full custody and self control.

🚀
ONE Bot 🧚‍♀️: Upcoming Features ❤️‍🔥
Upcoming features for our beloved @harmony1bot: Expert shortcuts + context loading; Chat on website or documents or transcripts; Custom image models or characters; Phone conversations with intent. Join our development + user group @onebotlove!
Our Q4 goals are 100 custom Stable Diffusion models (from CivitAI and HuggingFace), 1000 public and private data sources (as GPT4 context or embeddings), and $100K @harmony1bot revenues and tokens with 5 developers or modelers or trainers. 
Our 3 key metrics are: the total fees users pay in ONE tokens (excluding the initial 100 ONE credits), weekly active users (the total unique Telegram accounts in the last 7 days), weekly user engagement (the total messages sent to bot in the last 7 days). 
Let’s focus on G – not for AGI (artificial general intelligence), but Gen (generative) AI with large language model (LLM).
 
🎿
OnlyBots: Gen (AI) Tokens for Models, Embeds & Trainings
💍 ONE (Bot) Love – For ALL your AI (Wishes) 🧚‍♀️! @onebotlove
Many models, agents, characters.. as ONE bot @harmony1bot.
A user group to #build 100+ productivity, entertainment, personalization.. in harmony.
Pay-PER-Use, not $20 monthly. SMALL social groups, discreet & omnipresent.
💬 /ask: Ask Me Anything – ChatGPT4
/translate LANGUAGE1 LANGUAGE2: Auto-detect source language, and repeat all chat messages with translation in multiple target languages. E.g. /translate en zh-HK zh-CN.
/sum URL: Crawl the website URL in our backend, then summarize the content with OpenAI ChatGPT4 + 32K context.
✅ E.g. /ask harmony.one/dear or . harmony.one/dear. 
(1024 bytes downloaded, 0.42 time elapsed, 0.3 ONE fees paid.)
✅ E.g. /sum harmony.one/dear, or /sum harmony.one/dear in 30 words. Then, all Substack and Notion content. 
🔥 /sum URL as USER with PASSWORD: use login credentials in plaintext for gated access, or via archive.org and archive.is for paywalls. E.g.  /sum www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-shines-during-apples-off-season-7f27fc58 with user email and password.
✅ Alias as “/ask summarize URL”,  and preprocess to expand all URL in /ask queries. E.g. /ask project mission inharmony.one/dear. 
Support dynamic or generated pages via a headless browser with Javascript execution. Later, support LangChain’s document loaders & transformers. 
Compare results with GPT4 (with plugins) on parsing and extracting – versus HTML/CSS preprocessed as plain text with optimized parsers.
Upload a PDF or Word or Excel file as Telegram messages, then /ask with the context of the document. Support 1000+ pages with chunking – to lift the limit of about 250 words or 500 tokens per page, or 64 pages for GPT4-32K token context window length. Or, use Anthropic’s 100K context.
/load URL. Recent public news, events, data as a prelude into the token context window. E.g. restaurant openings, theater trends, quarterly earnings. Initially, Creative Common only (instead of Crunchbase, Factual, NumeriAI). Later, a vector dataset marketplace for micro-payment and loyalties on base, derived or forked sets. 
Must be recent, otherwise foundational models are trained with all public data every few months. Must be small, only 32K context window (for GPT-4). In contrast, loading a specific news article gives much more depth and consistency on a well-scoped context; loading all movie characters, restaurant ratings, court filings, comedy sketches… requires vector stores as embeddings and similar search.
Celebrity or personality chat. Train on the transcripts of all available podcasts on a single person. E.g. 25k words and 143k characters for one 3-hour episode of Yuval Noah Harari with Lex Friedman.
📸 /image: Make a Photo – Stable Diffusion
/image take photo as reference input, via tagging Telegram messages with @harmony1bot, for project logos or brand characters. Already supported on Midjourney and RunwayML.
✅ /image model=MODEL embed=TRIGGER. Support 100 custom models and low-adaptation ranking (LoRa) from CivitAI. See its top creators, most popular images, and weekly metrics. Favorites: ar, dg, il, jl, tk, li, cg, aa, ac, jl.
/train. Upload 10 photos and train a new model – for celebrity, self, brand, comics characters. Support standard professional headshots for resume or bio pages. Lensa made $1M+ per day at launch.
/tell. Upload a photo, segment all objects, describe scenes, identify objects, add links under output words for image search or commerce purchase. Use Meta’s Segment Everything; use ChatGPT4 for further queries. A special but useful case, like object character recognition (OCR), is for whiteboard handwritings of in-person brainstorming as idea mazes.
/gif. Use style transfer to make Telegram animations, virtual gifts, or emoji reactions (from top domains or live docs). Rent an emoji character (among 3664 in Unicode) as Web3 identity, then combine up to 9 emoji icons as the social group logo. Telegram, Whatsapp, Line, Snap… each has $100M revenue to sustain 10+ years of development.
🗣️ /call: Phone Calls with Intent – Whisper
/call RESTAURANT. DATE, TIME, PEOPLE, SEATING, NOTES. NAME, CALLBACK. Not only synthesize speech from words, but to make a full phone call of conversations – with an intended goal to achieve. E.g. french laundry, napa valley. this fri 8/31, 6pm, 2 adults, 4 kids, outdoor patio, no allergy. stephen tse, (650)253-0000. 
/call PHONE. MESSAGE. E.g. (650)253-0000. grandma, i’ll be…
/answer via Twillo for picking up any calls. Instead of recording a voice message, answer with “Out of Office”, or verify the caller’s identity and importance, or fool spammers… – then full transcribe it to Telegram chat for semi-synchronous interactions or callbacks. 
🤩 Social Tokens & Emotion Capital
What do Web2’s OnlyFans and Web3’s friend.tech have in common? Social capital as tokens. OnlyFans made $5.6B revenues by 3.1M Gen Z creators in 2022, while friend.tech made $3.22M fees from $70.1M inflows among 100+ Gen Y influencers in 15 days. 
Now – let’s build a sustainable, onchain economy for Web∞’s HuggingFace and CivitAi. We are OnlyBots of Gen AI, on Harmony’s x.country, with generative models, vector embeddings, and low-rank trainings.
/tweet. User shares news article as URL on iOS, then ONE Bot tweets on x.com/stse its curated content by summarizing with key facts of metrics, timeline, conclusions – rather than original click-optimizing titles and opening sentence in web previews. 
It quotes the article text with focus on a predefined list of interest topics, opinionated takes based on earlier context and choice, and generate a new memetic image based on brand logos or popular characters. It can sprinkle emojis and hashtag slangs throughout the content, or expand it into long threads.
/intro @stephentse. friend.tech with tokens on connections and time slots. Using Karma3 reputation scores on Farcaster and Lens, as well as invite links with Timeless Wallet. 
Emoji reactions as shortcut commands:
📈 key numbers, 📊 metrics, 🔑 terms, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 names, 📅 dates, ⏳ time, 🚀 actions
👧 explain like i am 10, 👩‍⚕️ explain like i had a phd
1️⃣ summarize in 10 words, 3️⃣ sum in 30 words, 9️⃣ 99
/quote PERSON TOPIC. Get the best quote from the person on the topic, using earlier chats or surrounding context (group name, sender name, time, location). e.g. /quote jobs zen, is very close, but without the context, to “/ask jobs zen in isaacson book”.
/rem X: Y for remembering X is associated with Y, and /rem X? for recalling X. Using a key-value database for long-term memory of social groups. E.g. introduction with curated bio for each in a large social groups, /rem @yozi_eth: Zi Wang worked on Google Chrome, Google X, Android and Nexus from 2006-2015. He was Google’s first  global creative director for its hardware division and co-founded a Google research lab. E.g. /rem all googlers?
🤩 More for Expert Users
/333. Alias for making a 3x3x3 hierarchy summary: “X for Y but Z” on the top concepts, then 9 words in a proper sentence as a tag line on each of X, Y, Z – totally 27 lines as a 1-pager. Or, explain roadmap for the next 3 weeks, 3 months, and 3 quarters. Useful as a pitch story or study guide. E.g. “Uber for Kids but FREE”.
/mark 7. Highlight 7 phrases of the text in bright yellow – as the extractive summary but inlined for easy context.
/tag 5. Underline 5 of the most difficult terms of the text – with click links to explain in simpler terms, or cross-reference to its definition or usages inside the text. 
/timer INTERVAL TIME TEMPLATE for INPUT-LIST. E.g. /timer daily 10am quote steve on _ for work, life, love, style, health, food, art…
/save or /load CONTEXT. E.g. predefined restaurant lists, selection criteria, private meal reviews. As Custom instructions for ChatGPT but with multiple and indexed filings. 
/cite. Extract relevant parts from a blog or document URL – based on the current group  messages of questions and answers. For assisting “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) as founder interviews, customer support, or community management.
/make. Fork ONE bot with OpenAI Copilot – for your Zapier’s or Auto-GPT’s automations.
🔥 Tips, Aliases & Shortcuts
Extensive command aliases; optimized for beginner easy onboarding, desktop power uses and mobile casual demos. 
For example, the full slash command “/ask” or “/chat” or tagging with the bot Telegram username @harmony1bot for intuitive naming and meaning, but just the dot “.” or “/a” for quick typing, while “A.” or “a.” is the easiest to type on mobile phone (just “a”, double space for “.”, without shift for “.”). That is, use any of these aliases for the most commonly used interactions: /a /ask /chat A. a. . @harmony1bot. 
See the subpage here for the full list of aliases for all single letters, single symbols, double letters, and alternative wording.
🔥
ONE Bot: Tips, Aliases & Shortcuts
💡 Key Reference 
Context length is especially important for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG; Lewis et al., 2020) – which has emerged to be the predominant pattern for LLM industry use cases… this percentage would be even higher for enterprise use cases. For example, say a company builds a chatbot for customer support, for this chatbot to answer any customer question about any product, the context needed might be that customer’s history or that product’s information.

 💍 ONE Bot on Telegram for ALL Your AI (Wishes) 🧚
AUG 11, 2023
Can you access ALL possible AI models, agents, characters, services… as ONE bot in a harmonious interface that already has 1 billion users? How about Pay-per-Use rather than $20 monthly subscriptions for each of the hundreds of automation, intelligence, personalization… yet to come?

Why not chat with AI as if HER identity is another friend among your inner circles, or just a coworker on a pizza-small team, or some assistant among small customer groups? Among these SMALL social groups, such ONE bot will be helpful but discreet, omnipresent without distracting – boosting both the productivity and the entertainment of your life?

🤗 Small Social Groups
The future of social is Web3: anonymous in public but soul-bound reputable over years, permission-less to join but be ready for rage kicks, power votes for rights but social norms to maintain liveness.

We now live and work in Web∞ with AI bots where you will have hundreds of small social groups mixing your friends, coworkers, or even customers. No more being tied to a few centralized platforms with hundreds of connected or followed profiles.


Prompt? Broken but Together (Michael Benisty, Burning Man)
But how these groups share the payments and fees of AI bots? Better yet, can they create value together, sustaining to be a community of culture and wealth? Most certainly, yes. ONE bot can easily join any chat group of your choice of people, or your choice of different purposes and interests. So fluid group membership easily implies asset ownership, while emoji-reaction engagement implies governance like multi-signatures.

Now you see that Harmony is more than a network of validators or a platform of transactions – we innovate on the consensus protocol for people. Simply put and true across all systems, communication scales quadratically with n^2 message rounds for the n team size. Amazon argues the optimal size of productive team is measured by fitting them in a room and sharing a pizza or two – so 6 to 8 people as the best functional sub-team, depending on the strength of the leader to overcome the (wo)man-month myth.

Hence, keep your identity small in political ideals or professional reputation – much like a good programming interface in a pure, functional way. Remember, 51% majority is not consensus. And, Never Split the Difference between the given narrative of Democrats vs Republicans, China vs U.S., or life vs work.

🧠 Here’s an interesting quote from a speech given by Steve Jobs on July 15, 1983. What would Jobs think of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence forty years later?

When I was going to school, I had a few great teachers and a lot of mediocre teachers. And the thing that probably kept me out of jail was the books. I could go and read what Aristotle or Plato wrote without an intermediary in the way. And a book was a phenomenal thing. It got right from the source to the destination without anything in the middle.

The problem was, you can’t ask Aristotle a question. And I think, as we look towards the next fifty to one hundred years, if we really can come up with these machines that can capture an underlying spirit, or an underlying set of principles, or an underlying way of looking at the world, then, when the next Aristotle comes around, maybe if he carries around one of these machines with him his whole life—his or her whole life—and types in all this stuff…

... then maybe someday, after this person’s dead and gone, we can ask this machine, “Hey, what would Aristotle have said? What about this?” And maybe we won’t get the right answer, but maybe we will. And that’s really exciting to me. And that’s one of the reasons I’m doing what I’m doing.`
